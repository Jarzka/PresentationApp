How to create a basic presentation
===============================================================

All presentations are located in presentations folder. Individual presentations are stored
in sub-folders. You can start creating your own presentation by making a copy of example_presentation
and naming it, for example, my_presentation.

Presentation folder contains the following folders:

/media

    This folder contains all images and videos used in the presentation.

/scripts/js

    This folder contains SlideController.js. This file can be used to add additional
    functionality to your presentation slides. The program slides with SlideController,
    you will need basic JavaScript / jQuery skills.

    If you do not need JavaScript functionality in your presentation, you can simply
    leave SlideController.js as it is or clean the initializeController function's content like this:
    this.initializeController = function() {}
    Therefore SlideController does not do anything.

/style

    This folder contains slides.css file that you can use to modify your slides style with CSS.

    If you wonder what is the difference between presentation theme and slide style,
    here is an explanation: Presentation theme defines the general theme that is used
    in all slides, like text colors, background image, fade etc. With slides.css you can modify
    the style of individual slides like changing text colors and moving items in different locations.

slides.html

    This file contains your presentation's slides in HTML format. Examine the example slides
    to understand the slide structure.

presentation.js

    This file contains basic information about your presentation.
    Currently the only thing in this file is the theme name.
    If you want use some other theme instead of the default theme,
    edit the file like this:
    var theme = "theme_love";

Once your presentation is ready, open index.html and find the following line:
var presentationName = "example_presentation";
Change presentationName to match your presentation's folder name. For example:
var presentationName = "my_presentation";

To run your presentation, open index.html with your HTML5 compliant web browser.

===============================================================
Custom theme
===============================================================

You need basic CSS skills if you want to create a custom theme for your presentation.

All themes are located in the themes folder in sub-folders. The folders contain CSS theme files that can
be used in presentations. If you want to make a custom theme for your presentation,
make a copy of theme_basic folder and modify it's contents. After you are done, go to your presentation's
folder, open presentation.js and change the presentation theme name to match your custom theme.
