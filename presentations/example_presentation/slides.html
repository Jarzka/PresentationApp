    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>This is a simple presentation app made using HTML5 technologies.</p>
    <p>There are three ways you can use to navigate these slides:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Keyboard buttons left / right and space.</li>
        <li>Clicking left / right arrow buttons (move your mouse at the bottom of the page to see the buttons).</li>
        <li>Swiping left / right.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The next slides will cover some features that are supported in this app.</p>
    <p>If you want to view this presentation in full screen, pressing F11 should do it.</p>
</section>

<section class="slide slide-basic">
    <h1>Fades</h1>
    <p>As you can see, the presentation supports fades between slides.</p>
    <p>These fades are made using CSS 3D transformations.</p>
</section>

<section class="slide slide-basic">
    <h1>Images & Video</h1>
    <p>The presentation is not limited to text only. It supports adding images and videos:</p>
    <img src="media/images/test.jpg" class="image-40">
    <iframe width="480" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/dGGjU4yoqIo?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</section>

<section class="slide slide-basic">
    <h1>Presentation Theme</h1>
    <p>The presentation theme can be changed easily. You can switch between different themes with the following links:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a id="theme-default" href="#">Default Theme</a></li>
        <li><a id="theme-basic" href="#">Basic Theme</a></li>
        <li><a id="theme-green" href="#">Green Theme</a></li>
        <li><a id="theme-love" href="#">Love Theme</a></li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="slide slide-basic slide-custom-a">
    <h1>Slide Style</h1>
    <img src="media/images/test.jpg" class="image-a image-40">
    <p>Changing presentation theme does not, however, change individual slide styles. This slide contains individual text style and image position.</p>
    <p>The next slide is so called "title slide".</p>

    <h2>And its features</h2>
</section>

<section class="slide slide-basic">
    <h1>Responsive Design</h1>
    <p>The presentation works well on all kind of devices and screen sizes. If you are viewing the presentation on the desktop, try resizing the browser window size to see how the presentation responds to the change.</p>

    <h1>HTML5 vs PowerPoint?</h1>
    <p>There are many advantages using this or similiar HTML5 presentation software instead of PowerPoint. Think about the following benefits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>This app is free and open source software. It is also cross-platform between Windows, Mac and Linux, smart phones, tablets etc. You only need an HTML5 compliant web browser.</li>
        <li>You can share the presentation easily with your audience and they can follow along with their own device.</li>
        <li>HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript are very powerful technologies and these slides are fully programmable. Want to create a Tetris on one slide? Go for it!</li>
        <li>Multiple users can edit the presentation at the same time (you will probably need Git for that).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are, however, some reasons why you might want to stay with PowerPoint:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It is an industry standard tool with lots of tutorials and support.</li>
        <li>You like to work with graphical tools.</li>
        <li>You dislike HTML5 (shame on you!).</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="slide slide-basic">
    <h1>Custom Presentations</h1>
    <p>If you want to use this presentation app to make your own presentation, feel free to do so. This presentation app is free and open source software. The source code can be found from the project's <a href="#">GitHub page</a>.</p>
    <p>The presentations are located in separate folder so you can create as many presentations as you want and use this app to show them. The slides can be modified easily if you know a little bit of HTML. New themes can be created with CSS.</p>
    <p>New features to be released in the future: PDF Export, autoplay...</p>
